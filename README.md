# Web3 Bidding Platform

This project is a Web3-based bidding platform built using **Motoko** for backend smart contracts and **React** for the frontend. The project demonstrates how to build decentralized applications (dApps) using Internet Computer and a user-friendly interface for bidding on items.

## Features
- Decentralized bidding system
- Blockchain-based smart contracts powered by **Motoko**
- Responsive and interactive frontend built with **React**
- Privacy-focused architecture with click tracking and scalability

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or higher)
- [DFINITY SDK](https://dfinity.org/developers) (`dfx`)

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install dependencies
First, install the necessary packages for both the frontend and backend:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### 2. Start the DFINITY local environment
Run the following command to start the DFINITY network locally:
\`\`\`bash
dfx start
\`\`\`

### 3. Deploy the Motoko canisters
After starting the local network, deploy your smart contract canisters using the following command:
\`\`\`bash
dfx deploy
\`\`\`

### 4. Run the React frontend
Finally, run the frontend React application:
\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`


## Usage

Once the local environment is running, open your browser and navigate to:
\`\`\`
http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

You should see the bidding platform, and you can interact with it by placing bids on items listed in the platform.
